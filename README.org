* eg.el

** Description
An Emacs wrapper for eg (https://github.com/srsudar/eg). Quoting the main repo:

#+begin_quote
eg provides examples of common uses of command line tools.

Man pages are great. How does find work, again? man find will tell you, but
you'll have to pore through all the flags and options just to figure out a
basic usage. And what about using tar? Even with the man pages tar is
famously inscrutable without the googling for examples.

No more!

eg will give you useful examples right at the command line. Think of it as a
companion tool for man.

eg comes from exempli gratia, and is pronounced like the letters: "ee gee".

** Requirements
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html][Emacs]] 24.3+
- `eg` itself. You can [[https://github.com/srsudar/eg#installation][install it from pip, homebrew, or source]].
#+begin_src sh
  pip install eg
#+end_src

** Install
It is not currently in a package repository such as MELPA. If I see this project get some stars or someone files an issue about it, I can submit it. Until then, you'll need to just download/clone it.

*** Manual
A fully manual approach might look like this.

#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/mnewt/eg.el.git "~/.emacs.d/"
#+end_src
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/eg.el")
  (require 'eg)
#+end_src

*** use-package / straight
If you use [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] you might do something like this.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package eg.el
    :ensure t
    :straight (:type git :host github :repo "mnewt/eg.el")
    :commands (eg eg-at-point))
#+end_src

** Usage
To get help for the ~find~ command:
#+begin_src 
  M-x eg RET find RET
#+end_src

The ~eg~ command will complete partial commands. It will also pre-populate the command if one is found at point.

To go straight to the help doc for the symbol at point:
#+begin_src 
  M-x eg-at-point RET
#+end_src
